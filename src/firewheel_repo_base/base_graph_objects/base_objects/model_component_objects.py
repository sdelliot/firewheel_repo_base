        VMRs that were written for pre-2.0 versions of FIREWHEEL.

        For VMRs which use this method, they should expect to be passed three file names:
        ``dynamic``, ``static``, and ``reboot``. The first two files contain the content described
        in the ``dynamic_arg`` and ``static_arg``. Finally, the VMR gets passed the path to a
        ``reboot`` file as their last argument on the command line. If the VMR creates that
        ``reboot`` file then the *VM Resource Manager* will restart the VM upon completion of
        the VMR (see :ref:`vmr-rebooting` for more details).

                This information can change from experiment to experiment.
                It generally takes the form of an ASCII string or a serialized object
                (i.e. a dictionary dumped into JSON format via :py:func:`json.dumps`).
                This content gets written into a file inside the VM and the filename is then
                passed to the VMR as the first command line parameter.
                Defaults to :py:data:`None`. However if it is not specified, an empty
                ``dynamic`` file path is still passed to the VMR.
            static_arg (str, optional): The name of a file that needs to be loaded into the VM.
                That filename is then passed to the VMR as its second command line option.
                Static content generally takes the form of an installer or other binary blob
                that the VMR requires in order to accomplish its purpose.
                This is something that does not change regardless of the experiment that
                is using it. Defaults to :py:data:`None`. However if it is not specified, an

            In this particular

            ``ex_vm_resource.py`` and the requirements in :ref:`using-vm-resources` have been
            satisfied. Since this is just a example, it doesn't use the arguments passed in, so

        r"""
        This method is intended to take any string and write it to a specified
        location on a VM.
        This method adds a :py:class:`base_objects.DropContentScheduleEntry` object to a
        :py:class:`Vertex's <firewheel.control.experiment_graph.Vertex>`
        :py:class:`base_objects.VmResourceSchedule`.

        There are some use cases where ``content`` needs to be written to a file inside a VM, but
        the ``content`` can not be generated until all topology changes to the graph have been
        completed. To handle this situation, ``content`` can point to a callback function that
        returns a string instead of containing the string directly.

        Router configuration is a good example of this. The router needs to look at the networks
        that are connected to it and its routing peers in order to know what must be included in
        its configuration. Since a router can be created in one model component, but the topology
        can change in subsequent model components, the router does not have all its required
        information at creation time. In the case of the ``VyOS`` router, its plugin drops a
        configuration file where the ``content`` argument points at a function that will return
        a string.

        All callback functions are executed as part of the
        :py:meth:`base_objects.VmResourceSchedule.get_schedule` method (see
        :ref:`vm-resource-schedule`). The :ref:`vm_resource.schedule_mc` model component calls
        :py:meth:`base_objects.VmResourceSchedule.get_schedule` for each
        :py:class:`Vertex <firewheel.control.experiment_graph.Vertex>` in the graph.

        Args:
            start_time (int): The schedule time (positive or negative) of
                when to perform the content write. (See :ref:`start-time` for more details).
            location (str): The absolute Unix-style path (including filename) on the
                VM to write the content. For example, to write content to
                ``C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\test.txt`` inside a Windows VM, the ``location``
                would need to be ``/Users/Administrator/Documents/test.txt``.
            content (str): The content to write out. This can be either a string, a
                serialized object (via :py:mod:`json` or :py:mod:`pickle`), or a function pointer.
                Function pointers can be passed in the content field for delayed content generation
                (see the examples below).
            executable (bool, optional): Should the file be made executable.
                This flag is ignored for Windows VMs. Defaults to :py:data:`False`.
            preload (bool, optional): If set, instead of dropping the content directly
                into ``location`` at ``start_time``, the content will be preloaded into a
                temporary location prior to any schedule entries running and then moved
                to ``location`` at ``start_time``. Defaults to :py:data:`True`.
                This is particularly useful for placing files into directories which will be
                created by another VMR.

        Returns:
            base_objects.DropContentScheduleEntry: The newly created schedule entry.

            **Drop Content Example with a Callback Function**

            The following is an example of using ``drop_content()`` with a callback function.
            This is taken from the :ref:`vyos_mc` model component.
            The callback function is implemented in the model component and is called
            ``self._configure_vyos``. It returns a string containing the configuration file
            for the router. That string is then written to
            ``/opt/vyatta/etc/config/firewheel-config.sh``.

            .. code-block:: python

                # Path to write the configuration file inside the router
                configuration_location = '/opt/vyatta/etc/config/firewheel-config.sh'

                # This is done by supplying a callback to the ScheduleEntry.

            The following example is a bit more straightforward.
            In this case the ``drop_content()`` function is provided a string to be written to a
            file in the VM. Since this example is using a Windows VM, the ``location`` for the
            content is a Unix-style path that translates to ``C:\Users\User\Desktop\hello.txt``
            in the VM.

        r"""
        This method allows a user to specify an executable to run and the arguments to pass to it
        on the command line. It supports both programs that are natively included in the VM
        (e.g. ``/sbin/ip`` or ``C:\windows\system32\ipconfig.exe``) as well as VM resources.
        This method adds a :py:class:`base_objects.RunExecutableScheduleEntry` object to a
        :py:class:`Vertex's <firewheel.control.experiment_graph.Vertex>`
        :py:class:`base_objects.VmResourceSchedule`.

        Args:
            start_time (int): The schedule time (positive or negative) of when to execute
                the specified program. (See :ref:`start-time` for more details).
            program (str): The name of the program or script to run.
                In general, it's safer to provide absolute paths for program
                names instead of relying on the environment of the VM to resolve
                the name.
            arguments (str or list, optional): This field allows a user to provide
                arguments for the program as either a single string or a list of strings.
                These get passed to the program on the command line. Defaults to :py:data:`None`.
            vm_resource (bool, optional): This parameter indicates if program is
                the name of a script that needs to be loaded on to the VM before
                execution. If ``vm_resource`` is :py:data:`True` then the specified program
                name is assumed to be the local filename of the file
                (i.e. not the full path, just the filename) to load on to the VM.
                That is, the file will be located within a model component.
                Defaults to :py:data:`False`.

        Returns:
            base_objects.RunExecutableScheduleEntry: The newly created schedule entry.

        Examples:
            **Native Executable Example**

            To run a program that is native to the VM, specify the Unix-style absolute path to
            the executable and optionally include arguments. For example, the ``ipconfig``
            executable on a Windows VM is located at ``C:\Windows\system32\ipconfig.exe``.
            The required Unix-style path for ``ipconfig`` would be
            ``/windows/system32/ipconfig.exe``. The path being absolute is not strictly required,
            but it is generally safer than assuming the program is part of the VM's ``PATH``.
            For example, the following runs the ``hostname`` command on a Linux VM at negative
            time ``-100``, passing in the name of the host as an argument.

            .. code-block:: python

                host = Vertex(self.g, "host")
                host.decorate(LinuxHost)
                host.run_executable(-100, '/sbin/hostname', host.name)


            **VM Resource Executable Example**

            Running a VMR file on a VM where arguments can be passed to it via the command line
            is very similar. The ``program`` needs to be the name of the VMR file and the
            ``vm_resource`` flag needs to be set to :py:data:`True`. For example, instead of calling
            the ``hostname`` command directly, let's run a VMR that calls the ``hostname`` command
            and adds the hostname to the ``/etc/hosts`` file. The VMR file will be called
            ``set_hostname.sh``:

            .. code-block:: bash

                echo $1 > /etc/hostname
                sed -i '/127.0.0.1/127.0.0.1    localhost '$1 /etc/hosts

            Standard VMR requirements for model components apply (see :ref:`using-vm-resources`).
            Executing the ``set_hostname.sh`` VMR on a
            :py:class:`Vertex <firewheel.control.experiment_graph.Vertex>` at time ``-100``
            passing in the name of the host as an argument is as follows:

            .. code-block:: python

                host = Vertex(self.g, "host")
                host.decorate(LinuxHost)

            the VNC session at a specific scheduled time during the experiment.
            First, the user should ensure that the recorded VNC session is included as a VM
            resource to the model component and must be provided to the ``extra_files`` parameter.
            In this example, assume our session is called `open-browser.vnc`.
            Then, the user would pass in the correct minimega syntax for replaying the recorded
            session (i.e., ``vnc play server-0 open-browser.vnc``).

            **Hotplugging USB Drive Example**

            Minimega can also dynamically
            `hotplug (or unplug) USB devices <https://www.sandia.gov/minimega/module-17-hotplugging-usb-drives/>`_.
            The desired USB drive must be available as a VM resource during the experiment
            and must be provided to the ``extra_files`` parameter.
            That way we can ensure that it is available on each physical host.
            In this example, assume we have a USB drive image called ``mydrive.img``
            that was created as follows:

            .. code-block:: bash

                # dd if=/dev/zero of=mydrive.img bs=1M count=1024
                # mkfs.fat mydrive.img
                # mkdir -p /tmp/mydrive
                # mount mydrive.img /tmp/mydrive
                # echo "This is a test" > /tmp/mydrive/test.txt
